#### Renaming a company 
Rename all instances of "companyX" to whatever "newname", including folder names.
Rebuild keystore and regenerate new keys in ``` system-tests/resources/vault/company1/company1-keystore.jks ```. Use [Keystore explorer](https://keystore-explorer.org/)  to edit the keystore. 

Web DIDs are available under ```system-tests/resources/webdid folder```. The publicKeyJwk section of each did.json was generated by converting the corresponding public key to JWK format, for example service connector public key was converted to JWK using following command:

```docker run -i danedmunds/pem-to-jwk:1.2.1 --public --pretty < system-tests/resources/vault/flughafen/public-key.pem > key.public.jwk```

Run the command and copy over the jwk into the respective .did file
